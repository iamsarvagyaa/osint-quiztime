Let's take on a new challenge! This one was posted by *Fiete Stegers on April 9th, 2021*. The question is simple: `"From where was this photo taken?"`. The image provided in the challenge was the following: [Challenge Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyjTiszXAAA0-mf?format=jpg&name=orig) and You can see the challenge at the following link: [Challenge Tweet Thread](https://twitter.com/fiete_stegers/status/1380585885419327490).

To start, we will download the image and then begin searching for clues. There were many clues in the image, and they were straightforward. Below are the clues:

![Clues](https://image-cdn.sarvagya.one/09-april-2021/clues.jpeg)

- [1.] A mobile tower, with logo **T**
- [2.] Motel reflection on glass window
- [3.] Sources of water ( something like pond, or fountain )
- [4.] Turning Road, and A flashing-board.

> I am not a native German Speaker, but I know the meaning of `Motel` is `Hotel`. So, I assume that `Motel` is a hotel. This can also be a clue that this hotel is in Germany, but let's break it down later.

Without wasting any more time, I decided to start my search for clues. To begin with, I checked `fiete's Twitter handle` and discovered that he is from Germany and from above small clue `motel`. This made me wonder if the challenge had something to do with a tower in Germany that has a *T logo*. As I began searching on Google for `T logo mobile tower in Germany`, I came across several images of towers with T logos that looked similar to the challenge logo image. I also found out that the tower is located in Cologne.

To confirm the location of the `Deutsche Telekom T-Mobile tower near Cologne, Germany`, I narrowed down the search results and found an image of a tower with a T-logo that belongs to T-Mobile. This confirms the location.

Now let's move on to the second clue, which is **"Motel"**. I rotated the image and glued it onto the original in order to make it easier to read. As we know both clues Germany and Cologne, so we can use *Google Maps* and *Google Earth* to narrow down the search. After searching for `"T-mobile tower in Cologne, Germany"` on Google Earth, I found a nearby `"Motel One Koln MediaPark"`. But why did I choose Motel One? Because it's located near a source of water.

After much searching, I finally located the Google Photos of Motel One, where I was able to find a plethora of additional clues that confirmed my suspicions. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the road leading up to the motel had a distinct curve, just as it did in the original photo. Furthermore, the infron of motel's building itself had a distinct curvature to it, which was also present in the original photo. I also observed a flashing board on the alternate to motel's exterior that was identical to the one in the photo, and finally, I noticed a nearby source of water that was consistent with the original photo as well. All of these findings provide strong evidence that the photo in question was indeed taken at Motel One.
