Hi, it's time for another Quiz Time solution. *Julia* posted a challenge on *June 6, 2023*. The question is `"Where is it?"` and `"What is happening next to it?‚Äù`. You can find the challenge and its details at the following link: [Challenge Tweet Thread](https://twitter.com/bayer_julia/status/1665826499977420802) and The image provided in the challenge was the following: [Challenge Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fx40Xy4XsAUaiCO?format=jpg&name=orig).

I must say, I found this quiz to be quite enjoyable. Although it tricked me a fair bit, given that I am from *India and not Germany*. Initially, Downloaded the image I began by searching for clues to help me answer the questions, but to my surprise, the only clue available was the building itself. Considering that **Julia is from Berlin**, and in order to obtain more refined search results on Google, I decided to switch on my VPN and connect to a server located in Germany.

After rotating the image, I conducted a quick search on Google Photos to find similar pictures. Fortunately, I came across a photo that looked almost identical to the one I had just rotated. Intrigued, I clicked on the image and was redirected to a website called ["Wikiwand"](https://www.wikiwand.com/de/Liste_der_Hochh%C3%A4user_in_Berlin). This website appeared to be an online encyclopedia, and I was surprised to see that it mentioned the image as being of the [Twin Towers in Treptow, Berlin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/TwinTowers_BerlinTreptow.jpg).

After comparing the quiz image and the `"twin-towers image,"` it's clear that they are completely similar. This is a promising development as it means we have found the location we were searching for. Now, we can move on to the next question, which is `"what is happening next to it?"`.

This situation presented a bit of a challenge for me since I realized that I was already almost 7 days late. In order to quickly find out what events were happening near Twin Treptower Berlin, I turned to Google and searched for `events happening nearby twin treptower berlin`. I even went as far as to adjust my search settings to show results from the past month only. Luckily, I was able to find a website that listed most of the upcoming events in [Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/events/jahresuebersicht/juni/).

After browsing through the list of events, I stumbled upon one that seemed particularly interesting- Re:publica. This event was conveniently located near Twin Tower, making it a great option for me to check out. With a little more research, I discovered that Re:publica is an annual conference that focuses on internet culture, digital media, and technology. It sounded like a great opportunity to learn more about the latest trends and innovations in the tech industry, and I couldn't wait to attend. But, unfortunately üòü
