Hey, Here is my solution to another Quiztime challenge. On *June 3rd, 2020, LarsWienand* posted a relatively easy challenge to geolocate. You can see the challenge at the following link: [Challenge Tweet Thread](https://twitter.com/LarsWienand/status/1267904226870640640). The question posed in this challenge was `"Where did I take the photo?"`. The image provided in the challenge was the following: [Challenge Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZiAKpQWoAE1OcV?format=jpg&name=orig).

To begin with, I carefully downloaded the image and took my time to analyze every single detail. As I delved deeper into the image, I was able to uncover a plethora of important clues that provided me with valuable insights. Below are few clues that I was able to find:

![Clues](https://image-cdn.sarvagya.one/03-june-2020/clues.jpeg)

- [1.] Half-Timbered Framing House
- [2.] Car Number Plate Showing **WEL ...**
- [3.] Blumen Zauber written on board and wall
- [4.] A long tower located near Blumen Zauber

> I am not a native German Speaker, but I know the meaning of `Blumen` is `Flowers` and `Zauber` is `Magic`. So, I assume that `Blumen Zauber` is a shop that sells flowers. This can also be a clue that this shop is in Germany, but let's break it down later.

To begin with, let's explore the first clue, which is the Half-Timbered Framing House. According to my knowledge/experience, half-timbered houses can be found in countries such as Germany, Japan, and China. However, a quick internet search reveals that these types of houses can be found in various locations around the world, Germany also. Based on the image provided, it appears that the house in question is likely located in Germany.

The second clue that we have is the vehicle registration code `WEL` found on the car number plate. We assume that this car may be local, and therefore I conducted an online search on the vehicle registration codes of **Germany**. Fortunately, we stumbled upon a Wikipedia page that contained a list of these codes. Upon further reading, we found that the WEL code corresponds to the **Limburg-Weilburg district** located in the state of Hesse, Germany. With this information, we can narrow down our search to this region.

The third clue that we have is the **Blumen Zauber** written on the board and wall. A quick Google search, `blumen zauber in weilburg germany`, reveals that Blumen Zauber is a flower shop located in the Limburg-Weilburg district of Hesse, Germany. With this information, we can narrow down our search to this region.

After analyzing the available image of the Blumen Zauber shop, we went through a search for additional evidence to determine its location. A Google search led us to discover a similar image in the challenge image, which featured the same board with the name **"Blumen Zauber"** and the same pillars as seen in the original image. However, we still had one more clue to follow: the tower.

The fourth clue we have is the tall tower located near Blumen Zauber. I searched for this location on **Google Earth** and found the **Weilburg Castle/Tower** in the Limburg-Weilburg district of Hesse, Germany. This information allows us to narrow down our search to this region.

At last, we found the location: `Blumenzauber Merenberg, Weilburger Stra√üe, Merenberg, Germany`
